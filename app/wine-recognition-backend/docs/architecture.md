# Architecture Overview of the Wine Recognition Backend

## Introduction
The Wine Recognition Backend is designed to support a wine recognition application that utilizes machine learning for pairing logic, community pairings, expert recommendations, and open-source computer vision for wine recognition. This document outlines the architecture of the backend system, including its components, data flow, and interactions.

## System Components

### 1. **API Layer**
The API layer is built using Express.js and serves as the interface for the iOS client. It consists of the following routes:
- **Wines Route**: Manages wine data (add, update, retrieve).
- **Pairings Route**: Manages pairing data (add, retrieve community and expert pairings).

### 2. **Controllers**
Controllers handle the business logic for the API routes:
- **WineController**: Contains methods for managing wine data.
- **PairingController**: Contains methods for managing pairing data and logic.

### 3. **Services**
Services encapsulate the core functionalities:
- **RecognitionService**: Implements wine recognition logic using computer vision techniques.
- **PairingService**: Implements pairing logic based on community feedback and expert recommendations.
- **FeedbackService**: Processes user feedback to improve pairing suggestions and recognition accuracy.

### 4. **Machine Learning**
The ML component consists of:
- **Training Scripts**: Scripts for training the pairing model using historical data.
- **Inference Scripts**: Scripts for recognizing wine from images and providing pairing suggestions.
- **Pipeline**: Manages the data flow through the ML processes.

### 5. **Computer Vision**
The vision component utilizes open-source libraries to:
- Detect wine bottles in images.
- Classify wine labels for recognition.

### 6. **Database**
The database layer is managed using Prisma, which provides an ORM for interacting with the database. It includes:
- **Schema Definition**: Defines the structure of the database.
- **Migrations**: Manages changes to the database schema over time.

### 7. **Client Integration**
The iOS client communicates with the backend through a dedicated client class, which abstracts the API calls and handles responses.

## Data Flow
1. The iOS client sends requests to the API layer.
2. The API routes invoke the appropriate controllers.
3. Controllers call the relevant services to perform operations.
4. Services interact with the database and ML components as needed.
5. Responses are sent back to the client, providing the necessary data.

## User Feedback Loop
User feedback is collected through the FeedbackService, which analyzes the input to refine the pairing logic and improve the recognition model over time.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for the wine recognition backend, enabling efficient data management, machine learning integration, and user interaction. The modular design allows for easy updates and scalability as the application evolves.
